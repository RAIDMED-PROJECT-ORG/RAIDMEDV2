Company may communicate any such change via the Service, the effective date posted in connection with this Agreement, electronic mail or other permitted notice. Following any such notice, continued use of the Service after the effective date of the change constitutes Customer\u2019s acceptance of that change.\n\n3. **PAYMENTS.**\n\n    1. **Free Trials.** If Customer is using a free version of the Services, all usage of the Services will be subject to all applicable terms and limitations communicated to Customer by Company including during Registration. Upon expiration of the trial, Customer must pay all applicable fees for continued use of the Services.\n    2. **Fees.** Customer agrees to pay Company all fees in the amounts and at the times specified during Registration, and as otherwise provided in this Agreement. Such fees may be specified as being payable in advance or in arrears; fees may be fixed, contingent or variable (e.g., depending on usage factors); and fees may be specified on a recurring basis (e.g., subscription fees and/or usage fees, which may be payable monthly, quarterly or annually) or non-recurring basis (e.g., one-time activation fees). If Customer exceeds any user or usage limitations specified during Registration, then Company shall invoice Customer, and Customer shall pay, for such additional users or usage at the overage rates set forth on the Registration (or if no overage rates are set forth during Registration, at Company\u2019s then-current standard overage rates for such usage). For the avoidance of doubt, Customer\u2019s failure to timely pay all fees due under this Agreement will be considered a material breach of this Agreement, and without limiting any of Company\u2019s rights and remedies hereunder, Company may terminate this Agreement or suspend Customer\u2019s access to the Service until such fees are paid.\n    3. **Payment Terms.** Unless specified otherwise, all amounts due hereunder shall be paid in full (without deduction, set-off or counterclaim) within 30 days after invoice in US dollars at Company\u2019s address or to an account specified by Company. Past due amounts shall bear a late payment charge, until paid, at the rate of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount permitted by law, whichever is less. Customer agrees to reimburse Company for all costs (including attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred by Company in collecting late payments.\n    4. **Payment Methods.** Company may use a third-party payment processor (the **\u201cPayment Processor\u201d**) to bill Customer through a payment account linked to Customer\u2019s account on the Services (**\u201cBilling Account\u201d**) for use of the Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement. Currently, Company uses Stripe, Inc. as our Payment Processor. Customer can access Stripe\u2019s Terms of Service at https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal and their Privacy Policy at https://stripe.com/us/privacy. Company is not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Services, Customer agrees to pay Company, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and Customer authorizes Company, through the Payment Processor, to charge Customer\u2019s chosen payment provider (Customer\u2019s **\u201cPayment Method\u201d**). Customer agrees to make payment using that selected Payment Method. Company reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment. The terms of Customer\u2019s payment will be based on Customer\u2019s Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between Customer and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of Customer\u2019s chosen Payment Method. If Company, through the Payment Processor, does not receive payment from Customer, Customer agrees to pay all amounts due on Customer\u2019s Billing Account upon demand.\n    5. **Taxes.** All payments required by this Agreement are exclusive of federal, state, local and foreign taxes, duties, tariffs, levies, withholdings and similar assessments (including without limitation, sales taxes, use taxes and value added taxes), and Customer agrees to bear and be responsible for the payment of all such charges, excluding taxes based upon Company\u2019s net income. All amounts due hereunder shall be grossed-up for any withholding taxes imposed by any foreign government.\n\n4. **CONFIDENTIALITY.**\n\n    1. **Scope.** The term **\u201cConfidential Information\u201d** means all trade secrets, know-how, inventions, developments, software and other financial, business or technical information disclosed by or for a party in relation to this Agreement, but not including any information the receiving party can demonstrate is (a) already known by it without restriction, (b) rightfully furnished to it without restriction by a third party not in breach of any obligation to the disclosing party, (c) generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement or (d) independently developed by it without reliance on such information.

Each party shall be responsible for any breach of confidentiality by its employees and contractors. Promptly after any termination of this Agreement (or at the disclosing party\u2019s request at any other time), the receiving party shall return all of the other\u2019s tangible Confidential Information, permanently erase all Confidential Information from any storage media and destroy all information, records and materials developed therefrom. Each party may disclose only the general nature, but not the specific terms, of this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party; provided, either party may provide a copy of this Agreement or otherwise disclose its terms in connection with any legal or regulatory requirement, financing transaction or due diligence inquiry.\n    3. **Compelled Disclosure.** Nothing herein shall prevent a receiving party from disclosing any Confidential Information as necessary pursuant to any court order, lawful requirement of a governmental agency or when disclosure is required by operation of law (including disclosures pursuant to any applicable securities laws and regulations); provided, prior to any such disclosure, the receiving party shall use reasonable efforts to (a) promptly notify the disclosing party in writing of such requirement to disclose and (b) cooperate with the disclosing party in protecting against or minimizing any such disclosure or obtaining a protective order.\n\n5. **PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.**\n\n    1. **Customer.** Except for the limited rights and licenses expressly granted hereunder, no other license is granted, no other use is permitted and Customer (and its licensors) shall retain all rights, title and interests (including all intellectual property and proprietary rights) in and to the Customer Data.\n    2. **Company.** Except for the limited rights and licenses to access and use the Service and Documentation expressly granted hereunder, no other license is granted, no other use is permitted and Company (and its licensors) shall retain all rights, title and interests (including all intellectual property and proprietary rights) in and to the Documentation, Platform, Service and Analytics.\n    3. **Restrictions.** Customer shall not, directly or indirectly (a) use any Company Confidential Information to create any software, platform, service or documentation that is similar to the Platform, Service or Documentation, (b) attempt to access any Platform or Service component or to disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise discover any source code or underlying organization, structures, ideas or algorithms of the Platform or Service, (c) encumber, sublicense, distribute, transfer, rent, lease, lend, access or use the Platform or Service in any time-share or service bureau arrangement, (d) copy, adapt, combine, create derivative works of, translate, localize, port or otherwise modify the Platform, Service or Documentation, (e) use or allow the transmission, transfer, export, re-export or other transfer of any product, technology or information it obtains or learns pursuant to this Agreement (or any direct product thereof) in violation of any export control or other laws and regulations of the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction or (f) permit any third party to do any of the foregoing.

Any inconsistent or additional terms on any related purchase order, confirmation or similar form, even if signed by the parties hereafter, shall have no effect under this Agreement. Except as expressly provided herein, no change, consent or waiver under this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against which enforcement is sought. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as a waiver of such rights, and the exercise of one right or remedy will not be deemed a waiver of any other right or remedy. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is in English only, which language shall be controlling in all respects.

Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of Section 4 or 5, the non-breaching party will suffer irreparable damage for which it will have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable remedies to prevent or restrain such breach or threatened breach, without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond.\n    4. **Notices.** All notices under this Agreement will be in writing, in English and delivered to the parties at their respective addresses stated herein, during Registration or at such other address designated by written notice.

However, without consent, Company may subcontract performance of all or any part of the Service, and either party may assign this Agreement to any successor to all or substantially all of its business which concerns this Agreement (whether by sale of assets or equity, merger, consolidation or otherwise). This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors, representatives and permitted assigns of the parties hereto.\n    7. **Independent Contractors.** The parties shall be independent contractors under this Agreement, and nothing herein will constitute either party as the employer, employee, agent or representative of the other party, or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose.\n    8. **Acknowledgment.** Customer acknowledges that (a) it has read and understands this Agreement, (b) it has had an opportunity to have its legal counsel review this Agreement, (c) this Agreement has the same force and effect as a signed agreement, (d) Company requires identification of the Customer before issuing this license to access and use the Service and (e) entering into this Agreement does not constitute general publication of the Platform, Analytics or Documentation.\n"})})}var a=n(55103),s=n(80314);function c(){return(0,i.jsx)(a.DQ,{children:(0,i.jsx)(s.z,{className:"max-w-[1024px] mx-auto",children:(0,i.jsx)(o,{})})})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[1758,9774,2888,179],(function(){return t=19433,e(e.s=t);var t}));var t=e.O();_N_E=t}]);
